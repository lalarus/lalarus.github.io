::: {#content-about .text-medium}
üëãüèª I‚Äôm Larry, a German based in Stockholm, who recently finished her Master thesis on deceptive design patterns.

I use design to create understanding, spark compassion, and drive action. I work with user studies and user experience design. Sometimes I also code, like this website. You‚Äôll usually find me talking about value-sensitive design, initiatives and people that drive climate action, or great data visualization.

In real life, I enjoy [focal things](about.qmd) (as A. Borgmann would put it); being in nature on a hike. The smell of roasted onions in the pan. Feeling the strain in my body during a run.
