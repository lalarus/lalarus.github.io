# Hi, I'm happy you're here.

## This is a h2 heading

### h3, you got the gist

#### this one should be 16 px * 1.5;

##### h5 is 16px * 1.25

###### no idea when I will ever use a h6 but it has the same size as p text

I’m Larry, a German based in Stockholm, who recently finished her Master thesis on deceptive design patterns.

I use design to create understanding, spark compassion, and drive action. I work with user studies and user experience design. Sometimes I also code, like this website. You’ll usually find me talking about value-sensitive design, initiatives and people that drive climate action, or great data visualization.


In real life, I enjoy focal things (as A. Borgmann would put it); being in nature on a hike. The smell of roasted onions in the pan. Feeling the strain in my body during a run.
