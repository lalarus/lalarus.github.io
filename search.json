    "text": "Process\n\nClusterportal In A Federal State aims to foster cooperation and innovation between companies and businesses in the state.\nThe website‚Äôs core service is a database listing all cluster initiatives, clusters and state-wide networks in the federal state. Complemented by information on funding programs, industry news and persons to connect, the website aims to enable regional businesses to master transformation challenges and structural change.\n\n\nHowever, the website‚Äôs current appearance is far from being called innovative.\nFor this reason, the state‚Äôs ministry of Economic Affairs asked us to develop a redesigned Clusterportal. We put together a 9-week long design thinking process which involved all relevant stakeholders. Rooted in this user-centered approach, we aimed to develop the content, structure and requirements for a redesigned Clusterportal.\n\n\nThe kick-off workshop reveals: this project is more than just a design refresh.\nAs expected, the workshop participants described the current design of Clusterportal as outdated, too text-heavy, and not intuitive. Beyond that, we identified an even more profound problem: it was unclear to our client whether and how different stakeholders were using the website. Moreover, they were undecided as to whom the website should address at all. We therefore had the participants work with context & stakeholder maps as well as HMW questions, defining the status-quo, target groups and objectives.\n\n\n‚Äú80% of the content is not relevant for me‚Äù: Stakeholder interviews shed light on current usage, pain points and needs.\nWe conducted 10 semi-structured interviews with representatives of all three target groups ‚Äì that was, cluster managers, business development managers, and company representatives. They commonly voiced the following concern: Clusterportal comes across as a self-promotion campaign for the state instead of meeting the needs of information seeking, networking and exchange.\n\nLearnings\nRecruiting (the right) interview participants requires considerable time and effort. We had 3 weeks to come up with a suitable interview guide based on the workshop results, recruit participants from all three target groups, conduct interviews, and analyze them. It turned out that 2 stakeholders ‚Äì business development managers and company representatives ‚Äì were not easy to recruit. Given the tight schedule, we were thus able to interview much fewer people from these target groups compared to the cluster managers.\n\n\n\nWe conduct a co-design workshop to move from interview insights to idea generation.\nWe presented our interview results during a second workshop with our client. Based on these insights, we had the participants develop personas that provided a clear picture of the three stakeholder groups. We then tasked them with sketching a subpage for each target group through card sorting and paper prototyping.\n\n\nWhere my main contribution comes in: Creating clickable prototypes.\nI created a clickable prototype that featured a dedicated area for each target group. In doing so, I incorporated the three design suggestions from the workshop. For the overall design, I chose a cleaner and text-reduced card layout because interviewees had criticized the current website as cluttered, counterintuitive, and non-responsive.\n\n\nAfter a third workshop of prototype testing and gathering feedback, I am faced with the challenge of creating a final prototype that considers everything we have learned so far.\nMeeting the need of all three target groups, the final prototype showcases events, success stories and news prominently on the landing page. I also designed for the needs of each target group. For example, to enable cluster managers to network and market their own cluster, each subpage now features a contact card which includes the person‚Äôs profile picture, responsibilities, and main areas of advice.\n\n\nThe outcome: a website prototype and a design specification document\nThe hand-off was preceded by several rounds of iteration with the client (see challenge). Apart from the prototype, I was also responsible for creating a design specification document as part of the client‚Äôs future request for proposal (RFP) for the website‚Äôs implementation. The document describes which technical and design criteria the future website should fulfill. The prototype visualizes the information structure and layout of the new website portal.\n\nLearnings\nPolitical interests can hamper a user-centered design. The client wished to abandon many design suggestions during the final iterations at the end of the project. Instead, the client asked to include and highlight content that had previously been considered too political and irrelevant by workshop participants and interview respondents alike."

While people‚Äôs failure rate is 31% for smoking and 28% for drinking alcohol, they fail to resist media use 78% of the time (see figure). This is because design mechanisms such as push notifications and autoplay create task interruptions and task-irrelevant thoughts that put an additional strain on the self-control capacity of media users. This loss of agency that users experience over their technology use comes with detrimental effects on their well-being. Short-term effects such as feelings of fruststration and guilt often translate to more long-term decreases in cognitive well-being, including behavioral addiction and reduced life satisfaction.

    "text": "Process\n\nI. Overall research process: moving from exploration to ideation\nTo answer this question, my research study design followed a design thinking process (see figure). I also used IDEO‚Äôs method cards to come up with suitable methods for the different phases of my research. Regarding the Discover phase, for example, I gleaned inspiration from the following three IDEO method cards: Secondary research, Try it yourself, and Cultural probes.\n\n\n\n‚Æ§ IDEO method cards that were selected in different phases of the research process, mapped on the Double Diamond design process model.\n\n\nAnalogue to the first Diamond of the design thinking process, I dedicated the first part of my research to exploring and understanding the problem. My research question was:\n\nRQ I: What existing design mechanisms in the Instagram mobile app influence sense of agency?\n\nThe inquiries in this phase included desk research, a probe study and its analysis through affinity diagramming. The results revealed distinct design features across Instagram‚Äôs design mechanisms that made participants feel less or more in control. I further identified 4 higher-level design patterns that describe how these design mechanisms undermine user sense of agency (see figure, visualized by four spherical shapes). The results informed my second research question:\n\nRQ II: What are alternative design mechanisms in the Instagram mobile app that might support sense of agency?\n\nAnalogue to the second Diamond of the design thinking process, the second part of my research process was concerned with finding solutions through ideating. For this, I developed four How might we (HMW) questions. Each question was based on one of the four design patterns for low agency. After generating a wide range of ideas, I chose to continue with one idea for each design challenge which resulted in a total of four experience prototypes. For potential inquries in the future I propose user testings to test whether the developed experience prototypes successfully support user sense of agency (see figure, visualized by using lower contrast).\n\n\n\n‚Æ§ Research study design\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Discover: From desk research to intervention\nI began my project with desk research, exploring the following three research areas: dark patterns of interaction design, philosophy of technology and previous work on sense of agency for well-being. The results contributed an essential component of groundwork to my research and informed the further course of my research process. For example, there is a need for research to identify and examine design patterns that manipulate users into spending time and attention in an app against their best interests (so-called attention capture dark patterns). 2\nI then designed and conducted my own intervention: a probe study with a total of 12 participants. My aim was to collect user experiences and form an empathic understanding of how existing design mechanisms in the Instagram mobile app influence user sense of agency. Each probe kit included 2 assignments and 2 corresponding diaries (see figure). The first assignment asked participants to name and explaing things that made them feel least in control (LC) of how they spend their time on Instagram. Thereafter, the second assignment asked them to name and explain things that made them feel most in control (MC).\n\n\n\n‚Æ§ A snapshot of the creation process of a diary (top-left), the cover of a final diary (top-right), and the first double page of a low control diary (bottom)\n\n\nBesides the diaries, each participant received a number of other materials (see figure). For example, the probe kit contained rubber bands to attach the diary to the back of a smartphone (see figure, A.2). This way, the diary accompanied participants in their daily routines.\n\n\n\n‚Æ§ The different materials included in one probe kit\n\n\n\n\nLearnings\n\nProbe studies require considerable time and effort. I underestimated the time that was required for participant recruitment, material preparation & shipment and on-going communication with participants. Moreover, almost half of all participants delayed the start of their assignment phase due to personal reasons. Also, since my sample included participants from different countries, delivery times varied and participants received their probe kits at different times.\nInstructions must be well thought through and leave no room for interpretation. While I committed a lot of effort to create comprehensive and clear instructions, some participants sought my advice during the assignment phase. I was particularly surprised that one participant did not understand how to attach the diary to their phone even though I had created step-by-step illustrations for it.\n\n\n\nIII. Define: Bringing all the data together\nI used affinity diagramming to analyze and synthesize the data gained from my probes studies. Affinity diagramming is a technique used to organize and make sense of large amounts of unstructured, far-ranging, and seemingly dissimilar qualitative data 3. I therefore found it a suitable tool for analyzing the fragmented and unclear nature of my probe study results. The final affinity diagram included 89 (89%) of all responses, grouping them into several clusters (pink labels) and two overarching themes (green labels) (see figures).\n\n\n\n‚Æ§ Affinity notes created from the data gained from the probe studies\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Æ§ A part of the finalized affinity diagram\n\n\n\n\nIterations\nAnalyzing and clustering data on your own is difficult. After asking a second person for feedback, I discarded my first affinity diagram and started from scratch.\n\nThe affinity diagram revealed distinct design mechanisms that influence user sense of agency in the Instagram app. They can be classified into 6 higher-level design patterns that describe how these design mechanism support or undermine user control. One example for such a higher-level design pattern for low control is the imposing design pattern (see figure). Imposing design patterns include design mechanisms that impose unwanted information on a user. Notifications and Ads were the two design mechanisms that undermined user agency most by being too imposing. The corresponding response from one participant stated:\n\n‚ÄúTrending reels notification ‚Äì Instagram prompts me to watch the most watched reels in Denmark today even though I have never asked for it.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n‚Æ§; Types of design patterns that classify design mechanisms that make people feel least in control over how they spend their time in the Instagram app. The description explains how a design pattern undermines user sense of agency. Design patterns are listed in the order of frequency of corresponding responses from the affinity diagram.\n\n\nFinally, I condensed my Define phase results into a actionable problem statement, the so-called Point of View (POV). The POV brings the process of understanding the problem to an end and at the same time acts as a link to the following Develop phase:\n\nInstagram users need to be more in control over how they spend their time in the Instagram app because current design mechanisms undermine their sense of agency, thereby deteriorating user well-being. This happens in four ways: by imposing unwanted information on users, by showing highly personalized content, by creating fear of missing out, and by determining the ease of an interaction.\n\n\n\nIV. Develop: designing to support user agency\nThe Develop phase of my research process related to the second research questio ‚Äì i.e., what are alternative design mechanisms in the Instagram mobile app that might support sense of agency? Picking up on the insights articulated in the POV, I first developed four How might we (HMW) questions. I used them as design challenges to foster the exploration of new ideas, concepts, and solutions. For example, regarding ease-of-use design patterns, I formulated the following HMW question: how might we redesign design mechanisms that determine how easily users can interact with the interface? I then used experience prototyping to develop solutions to these four HMW questions. For example, one experience prototype was a redesign of the Reels mechanism (see figure). It addressed the challenge mentioned above of redesigning ease-of-use patterns for a greater sense of user agency. The redesign focused on how easily users were able to see and consume new content. Results from the probe studies had shown that the frictionless design of the Reels mechanism undermined user control. More specifically, the ease of the scrolling gesture entrapped users in an ‚Äúendless loop of content‚Äù, making it hard for users to stop seeing more reels. Therefore, my experience prototype did not feature continuous scrolling but instead included a microboundary.\n\n\n\n\n‚Æ§ Mockups of the original design (left) and the redesign (right) of the Reels mechanism.\n\n\n\n\nLearnings\nIdeating on your own is tedious and lacks valuable feedback and inspiration from others. Here, this left me with insufficient time to test my prototypes."

They constitute redesigns of the following four design mechanisms in the Instagram app: Notifications, the General app UI, Feed & Stories, and Reels. The prototypes present best practices in how to design for greater user agency. However, ideating and developing these prototypes did not involve any co-creation activities. Future studies are needed to validate whether the redesigns successfully support digital well-being."
