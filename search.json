    "text": "Relevance: Capturing attention at all costs\nInformation technology is tightly woven through our contemporary lives, offering broad access to communication, knowledge, and entertainment. However, this wealth of information has made attention a scarce and therefore precious resource. This has resulted in a competition in which a very small number of exeptionally powerful organizations are continuously vying for people‚Äôs attention. Their technologies and products present ubiquitous temptations that frequently clash with other important activities in our lives. \n\n\nMoreover, information and communication technologies (ICT) are designed in a way that makes them exceptionally hard to resist: While people‚Äôs failure rate is 31% for smoking and 28% for drinking alcohol, they fail to resist media use 78% of the time (see figure). This is because design mechanisms such as push notifications and autoplay create task interruptions and task-irrelevant thoughts that put an additional strain on the self-control capacity of media users.  This loss of agency that users experience over their technology use comes with detrimental effects on their well-being. Short-term effects such as feelings of fruststration and guilt often translate to more long-term decreases in cognitive well-being, including behavioral addiction and reduced life satisfaction. I therefore asked:\n\nHow can we design interfaces that give back control (i.e., user agency) toward the people who interact with these interfaces?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Æ§ Media use shows the highest self-control failure rate of all 14 types of temptations. 1"

The results revealed distinct design features across Instagram‚Äôs design mechanisms that made participants feel less or more in control. I further identified 4 higher-level design patterns that describe how these design mechanisms undermine user sense of agency (see figure, visualized by four spherical shapes). These results informed my second research question:\n\nRQII: What are alternative design mechanisms in the Instagram mobile app that might support sense of agency?\n\nAnalogue to the second Diamond of the design thinking process, the second part of my research process was concerned with finding solutions through ideating. For this, I developed four How might we (HMW) questions. Each question was based on one of the four design patterns for low agency. After generating a wide range of ideas, I chose to continue with one idea for each design challenge which resulted in a total of four experience prototypes. For potential inquries in the future (see figure, visualized by using lower contrast) I propose user testings to test whether the developed experience prototypes successfully support user sense of agency.\n\n\n\n‚Æ§ Research study design"

The results contributed an essential component of groundwork to my research as well as informed the further course of my research process. For example, there is a need for research to identify and examine design patterns that manipulate users into spending time and attention in an app against their best interests (so-called attention capture dark patterns). 2\nI then designed and conducted my own intervention: a probe study with a total of 12 participants. My aim was to collect user experiences and form an empathic understanding of how existing design mechanisms in the Instagram mobile app influence user sense of agency. Each probe kit included 2 assignments and 2 corresponding diaries (see figure). The first assignment asked participants to name and explain things that made them feel least in control (LC) of how they spend their time on Instagram. Thereafter, the second assignment asked them to name and explain things that made them feel most in control (MC).\n\n\n\n‚Æ§ A snapshot of the creation process of a diary (top-left), the cover of a final diary (top-right), and the first double page of a low control diary (bottom)\n\n\nBesides the diary, each participant received a number of other materials (see figure).
