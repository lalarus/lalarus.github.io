I therefore explored how we can design interfaces that give back control (i.e.¬†user agency) toward the people who interact with these interfaces. \n\n\n\nFollowing a design thinking approach, I used desk research, probe studies and affinity mapping to explore how design mechanisms on Instagram support and undermine user control. Through experience prototyping, I then developed alternative design patterns that support sense of agency.\n\n\n\nI identified six design patterns that describe how design mechanisms on Instagram support and undermine user control. I further developed 4 prototypes that redesign Instagram‚Äôs design mechanisms for greater user agency."

    "text": "TLDR \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\nAs a local youth organization that aims to push climate and sustainability action, Green Kolding struggles to attract participants. Another problem is its members‚Äô uncertainty about what Green Kolding stands for.\n\n\nApproach\nI conceptualized and conducted a co-design workshop to explore and define Green Kolding‚Äôs identity. We then interviewed the two heads of the organization. Analyzing the data with empathy mapping identified the need for a website which communicates Green Kolding‚Äôs identity and attracts new members. We developed a website prototype and conducted user experience tests with the target group.\n\n\nSolution\nThe workshop‚Äôs goal was to define Green Kolding‚Äôs identity but this was difficult because the number of attendants who regularly engage with Green Kolding was very low. Despite this, our interviews led to a deeper understanding of the organization‚Äôs self-perception and needs. We addressed those needs with a website prototype but testing it revealed that Green Kolding‚Äôs identity remains vague and discourages potential members from joining.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncubating‚Ä¶\nüê£ This part is about to hatch.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
