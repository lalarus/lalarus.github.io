No cookies, no cookie banner either.\nThe ‚ÄúI do not track you‚Äù declaration in the footer of my page is inspired by Laura Kalbag. I warmly recommend her blog if you want to know more about rights-respecting design, accessibility and privacy in the web."

My role as a UX designer included initial design research, creating user flows and early sketches, low- and high-fidelity prototyping as well as validation testing.\n\n\nBackground\nscitis.io offers an IoT framework to optimize production processes in various industriy sectors such as metalworking, energy, process engineering and packaging. Their Cloudplug is a hardware devices that collects data from various sources, e.g.¬†production equipment, automation systems, and sensors. Sending the data to the Cloud Backend, the scitis IoT platform allows the monitoring of production processes in real-time, collecting production data and quality data, tracking production workflows, controlling machines, and analyzing production data to improve efficiency and quality of production. The interface allows manufacturers to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in their operation and take corrective action, resulting in increased productivity and reduced downtime.\n\nCustomer-specific projects\n\nVisualizing target quantity and actual quantity on a customized dashboardThe Lorenz Bahlsen Snack-World GmbH & Co KG Germany\nDeveloping a navigation architecture for the filtering and displayal of several hundreds of connected production machinesIngersoll Rand Inc.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral platform improvements\n\nAdapting the interface for multiple user roles with different user flows and access rights\nReporting production errors and downtimes\n\n\n\n\nIncubating‚Ä¶\nüê£ This part is about to hatch.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "TLDR \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn today‚Äôs attention economy, digital interfaces undermine self-control. This results in detrimental effects on user‚Äôs well-being. I therefore explored how we can design interfaces that give back control (i.e.¬†user agency) toward the people who interact with these interfaces. \n\n\n\nFollowing a design thinking approach, I used desk research, probe studies and affinity mapping to explore how design mechanisms on Instagram support and undermine user control. Through experience prototyping, I then developed alternative design patterns that support sense of agency.\n\n\n\nI identified six design patterns that describe how design mechanisms on Instagram support and undermine user control. I further developed 4 prototypes that redesign Instagram‚Äôs design mechanisms for greater user agency."

Another problem is its members‚Äô uncertainty about what Green Kolding stands for.\n\n\nApproach\nI conceptualized and conducted a co-design workshop to explore and define Green Kolding‚Äôs identity. We then interviewed the two heads of the organization. Analyzing the data with empathy mapping identified the need for a website which communicates Green Kolding‚Äôs identity and attracts new members. We developed a website prototype and conducted user experience tests with the target group.\n\n\nSolution\nThe workshop‚Äôs goal was to define Green Kolding‚Äôs identity but this was difficult because the number of attendants who regularly engage with Green Kolding was very low. Despite this, our interviews led to a deeper understanding of the organization‚Äôs self-perception and needs. We addressed those needs with a website prototype but testing it revealed that Green Kolding‚Äôs identity remains vague and discourages potential members from joining.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncubating‚Ä¶\nüê£ This part is about to hatch.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
