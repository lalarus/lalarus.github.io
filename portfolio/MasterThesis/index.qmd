## TLDR {{< iconify fa-solid certificate size=0.75em >}} 

###### Problem
In today's attention economy, digital interfaces [undermine self-control]{.highlight}. This results in detrimental effects on user's well-being. I therefore explored how we can design interfaces that give back control (i.e. user agency) toward the people who interact with these interfaces. <br><br>

###### Approach
Following a design thinking approach, I used [desk research]{.highlight}, [probe studies]{.highlight} and [affinity mapping]{.highlight} to explore how design mechanisms on Instagram support and undermine user control. Through [experience prototyping]{.highlight}, I then developed alternative design patterns that support sense of agency.<br><br>


###### Solution

I identified six design patterns that describe how design mechanisms on Instagram support and undermine user control. I further developed [4 prototypes]{.highlight} that redesign Instagram's design mechanisms for greater user agency.

###### Problem
In today's attention economy, online platforms and digital technologies commonly design interfaces in a way that [undermines user's self-control]{.highlight}. This loss of agency that users experience over their technology use comes with [detrimental effects on their well-being]{.highlight}. Short-term effects such as feelings of fruststration and guilt often translate to more long-term decreases in cognitive well-being, including behavioral addiction and reduced life satisfaction. I therefore asked: how can we design interfaces that give back control toward the people who interact with these interfaces? Or more precisely, how can we design for the value of user agency?<br><br>


###### Approach
Following a design thinking approach, I used [desk research]{.highlight}, [probe studies]{.highlight} and [affinity mapping]{.highlight} to explore how design mechanisms on Instagram support and undermine user control. My results updated and substantiated the initital problem statement and informed 4 design challenges. I explored these design challenges with [experience prototyping]{.highlight}, developing alternative design patterns that might support sense of agency.<br><br>


###### Solution

Analyzing and synthesizing my data allowed me to identify [six design patterns]{.highlight} that describe how design mechanisms on Instagram support and undermine user control. Based on these results, I redesigned four existing design mechanisms on Instagram. Each of these [prototype]{.highlight} presents a best practice in how to design for greater user agency.

## Relevance: Capturing attention at all costs
In today's attention economy, online platforms and digital technologies commonly design interfaces in a way that undermines user's self-control.

such as push notifications and autoplay

Failing to resist media temptations results in a number of attentional harms and detrimental harms for user's well-being: 

This loss of agency that users experience over their technology use comes with detrimental effects on their well-being. Short-term effects such as feelings of fruststration and guilt often translate to more long-term decreases in cognitive well-being, including behavioral addiction and reduced life satisfaction. I therefore asked:

(Or more precisely, how can we design for the value of
user agency?*)

## Research study design: moving from exploration to ideation
I approached Every research project needs a research 

Research question I (RQ1): What existing design mechanisms in the Instagram mobile app influence sense of agency? 
Research question II (RQ2): What are alternative design mechanisms in the Instagram mobile app that might support sense of agency? 


In each of the four phases of the design
thinking process above, designers apply a range of
different tools and methods (Tschimmel, 2012)
I used IDEO's *method cards* to come up with suitable methods for each phase of the design thinking process of my research.


*Background:* 
- lecture on value-based design as inspiration

## Using Design Thinking to move from exploration to the ideation of new artifacts

![&#x2BA4; IDEO method cards that were selected in different phases of the research process, mapped on the Double Diamond design process model.](/portfolio/MasterThesis/img/1-designthinkingmethodcards.jpg){fig-alt="Two images separated by a vertical line. The image on the left shows a visualization of the Design thinking process model. Icons in blue that represent different types of method cards are mapped onto different phases in the model. The image on the right shows a hand holding a set of four method cards by IDEO"}

![&#x2BA4; Research study design](/portfolio/MasterThesis/img/1-researchstudydesign.jpg){fig-alt="A graphical representation of a research study design. It comprises two large rectangles with dotted borders. Outside the rectangle on the left is a text reading 'Phenomenon/problem' with an arrow pointing towards a text reading 'Aim'. Another arrow points from 'Aim' towards the inner space of the rectangle. Within this rectangle, a text in the top reads 'RQ1: What existing design mechanisms influence sense of agency?'. Below different research inquries and their dependencies to one another are visualized through various shapes and arrows. Reading from left to right, the different inquries are named: 'Desk research', 'Pilot probe study', 'Probe study' and 'Affinity diagram'. The shapes visualizing 'Affinity diagram' pass into the second large rectangle on the right side. Within this rectangle, a text in the top reads 'RQ2: What are alternative design mechanisms that might support sense of agency?'. Analogue to the first large rectangle, different research inquries and their dependencies to one another and to the inquries of the first large rectangle are visualized. Reading from left to right, the different inquries are named: 'Experience prototypes' and 'User testing'. Unlike the other inquries, 'User testing' is grayed out."}

- RQ 1 + RQ2

## Discover: From desk research to intervention

*DISCOVER: Desk Research*
**Dark patterns of interaction Design*
- no category + examples of attention capture dark patterns (= opportunity gap)

*Philosophy of technology*
- designers design affordances that infleunce the uses and impacts of their technological objects 
- self-control must be central to the design of information technologies

*Previous work on sense of agency for digital well-being*
- (re)designing internal mechanisms (= digital mechanisms that lie inside the Instagram app) presents a more promising approach to support user agency that the common strategy of designing external mechanisms 

*Probe study*

`Lesson learned: probe studies are a lot of work, instructions must be well thought-through`


## Define: Bringing all the data together

*DEFINE: Affinity mapping*

- PoV:
  - Instagram users need to be more in control over how they spend their time in the Instagram app because current design mechanisms undermine their sense of agency, thereby deteriorating user well-being. This happens in four ways: by imposing unwanted information on users, by showing highly personalized content, by creating fear of missing out, and by determining the ease of an interaction.

- 4 types of design patterns for least control
- 3 types of design patterns for most control

![&#x2BA4;; Types of design patterns that classify design mechanisms that make people feel least in control over how they spend their time in the Instagram app. The description explains how a design pattern undermines user sense of agency. Design patterns are listed in the order of frequency of corresponding responses from the affinity diagram.](/portfolio/MasterThesis/img/4-LCdesignpatterns.jpg){fig-alt="A photo of a redpoll."}

`Lesson learned: Analyzing on your own is hard, first affinity diagram was crap`

this one too?  
yip

but this one as well? 

## Develop: Designing to support user agency

*DEVELOP*
- 4 HMW questions / design challenges
- 4 prototypes

`Setback: Ideating on your own is hard, (no time for testing)`

My Master Thesis sheds light on the exploitative tactics with which online platforms and digital technologies systematically undermine user's self control. This loss of agency that users experience over their technology use comes with detrimental effects on their well-being.

Based on these findings, I used experience prototyping to create 4 prototypes. These redesigs support user sense of agency 

Taking one of most widespread social media platforms worldwide, my Master thesis explores and redesigns how design mechanisms influence user agency on Instagram.

such as push notifications and autoplay


Inspired by this, I stumbled upon the 


Lessons learned: TIME, not testing
Setbacks: probing is hell of work, ideating on your own is hard



## Solution link
Es gibt zwei Unterarten, A. h. hornemanni aus Grönland und den kanadischen Nachbarinseln sowie A. h. exilipes aus Nordamerika und Eurasien. Die grönländische Unterart ist größer und heller, manchmal überwiegend weiß. In Europa brütet der Polar-Birkenzeisig nur im nördlichsten Skandinavien. Im Winter hält er sich im gesamten Skandinavien und im Baltikum auf, Umherstreifende gelangen bis Island, Großbritannien und Mitteleuropa.

`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
