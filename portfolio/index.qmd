::: {#content-portfolio .text-medium}

Here's what I do: my work ranges from projects in interdisciplanary teams, assignments during my time at the University of Southern Denmark, to my own fiddling-arounds in my spare time. I aim to describe each project as a whole, including its detours and setbacks. After all, failure is part of the design process! <br>

Apart from that, don't hesitate to reach out if you want to know more about a specific project.
