## TLDR {{< iconify fa-solid certificate size=0.75em >}} 

##### Problem
As a local youth organization that aims to push climate and sustainability action, Green Kolding struggles to [attract participants]{.highlight}. Another problem is its members' uncertainty about what Green Kolding stands for.<br><br>

##### Approach
I conceptualized and conducted a [co-design workshop]{.highlight} to explore and define Green Kolding's identity. We then [interviewed]{.highlight} the two heads of the organization. Analyzing the data with [empathy mapping]{.highlight} identified the need for a website which communicates Green Kolding's identity and attracts new members. We developed a website prototype and conducted [user experience tests]{.highlight} with the target group.<br><br>

##### Solution
The workshop's goal was to [define Green Kolding's identity]{.highlight} but this was difficult because the number of attendants who regularly engage with Green Kolding was very low.
Despite this, our interviews led to a deeper understanding of the organization's self-perception and needs. We addressed those needs with a [website prototype]{.highlight} but testing it revealed that Green Kolding's identity remains vague and discourages potential members from joining.
