#### Team
The team consisted of 1 product owner and several developers and data engineers. My role as a UX designer included design research, user flows, prototyping and visual design.<br><br>

#### Background
Lorenz, a manufacturer with multiple production lines and sites,
- record production downtimes
- consistent and systematic recording allows for analysis --> detect bottlenecks / inefficiences -> corrective action -> productivity + increased downtime -> increased OEE 

OPERATOR --> known and unknown causes
- How can I become aware of a downtime happening?

- How can I verify the cause of a downtime?
- How can I change/supplement the cause of a downtime?
- How can I add an (unscheduled) downtime manually?


SHIFT SUPERVISOR --> scheduled and unscheduled
- How can I get an overview of all downtimes? (Gesamtzahl auch wichtig)
- How can I edit entries retrospectively?
  - split downtime in two causes (scheduled only)
  - edit timestamp



#### Process
- overview: what are objectives, needs

anforderungen an das visual design: 
- optimized for tablet (big buttons, easily differentiable)
- easy onboarding
- as little as possible clicks to task completion

- user flows for each user group
- sketches
- prototyping

#### Outcome
- prototypes 
- UI elements: confirm | change/supplement | add | split downtime | edit timestamp
- 2 kinds of causes: known | unknown
- 2 kinds of downtimes: scheduled | unscheduled
- types of causes: Setup, disruption, repairs, cleaning, bottleneck

##### Challenges
- no interviews with actual customers --> what are needs? --> user testing

##### Iterations 
- Typ Stillstand -> von ausgeschrieben zu icon
- Zeige Meldungen der letzten --> angepasst an user und schicht (8h)
