In times where [businesses are built upon data collection](https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/about/), I am exploring how my designs can better account for human values. 

So I chose to avoid data collection: this website does not have analytics, third-party web fonts or social network buttons that track you. No cookies, no cookie banner either.


The "I do not track you" declaration is inspired by [Laura Kalbag](https://laurakalbag.com/).

That's why I avoid data collection on this website to respect user rights much better.

 decided against any cookie banners, by deciding against any cookies.
