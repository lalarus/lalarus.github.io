In times where [businesses are built upon data collection](https://shoshanazuboff.com/book/about/), I am exploring how my designs can better account for human values. 

One approach is that I decided against any data collection on my website: this website does not have analytics, third-party web fonts or social network buttons that track you. No cookies, no cookie banner either.

The "I do not track you" declaration in the footer of my page is inspired by [Laura Kalbag](https://laurakalbag.com/). I warmly recommend her blog if you want to know more about rights-respecting design, accessibility and privacy in the web.
