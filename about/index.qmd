##### [I'm a curious designer with an analytic mindset ...]{.highlight2 .italics} 
My main strength is my analytic mindset and my passion for research and complexity. I design to create understanding, spark compassion, and drive action. With my interdisciplinary background in human-computer interaction and branding, I call user studies and team collaboration the heart of my work approach.

##### [... who recently began coding ...]{.highlight2 .italics}
I also enjoy talking to different stakeholders and presenting progress to clients. Sometimes I also code, like this website. Once I become fascinated by something, I can immerse myself fully in it (which is why I actually code a lot right now). You’ll usually find me talking about ethics in design, initiatives and people that drive climate action, or great data visualization.

##### [... and stops by a (skiing) trail as soon as she sees one.]{.highlight2 .italics}
I enjoy fiddling around on a screen as much as taking some time off it. Like packing a tent and spending some days on a hike. The smell of roasted onions in the pan. Feeling the strain in my body during a run. Or playing countless rounds of [Doppelkopf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelkopf) with friends (I grew up in Germany).
