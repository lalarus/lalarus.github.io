#### [I'm a UX reseracher ...]{.highlight2 .italics} 
My main strength is my [analytic]{.highlight3} mindset and my passion for research and complexity. I have conducted several design research projects in the past where I was responsible for study design, data analysis and concept development. Playing volleyball at a competitive level for many years led me to call good communication and [team collaboration]{.highlight3} the heart of my work approach. With my background in [workshop facilitation]{.highlight3} and as [founder of a social startup]{.highlight3}, I also enjoy presenting and talking to different stakeholders.

#### [... who recently began coding ...]{.highlight2 .italics}
Sometimes I also [code]{.highlight3}, like this website. Once I become fascinated by something, I can immerse myself fully in it (which is why I actually code a lot right now). You’ll usually find me talking about ethics in design, initiatives and people that drive climate action, or great data visualization. Because every design is political!

#### [... and hops on a (skiing) trail as soon as she sees one.]{.highlight2 .italics}
I enjoy fiddling around on a screen as much as taking some time off it. Like [packing a tent]{.highlight3} and spending some days on a hike. The smell of [roasted onions]{.highlight3} in the pan. Choosing the yarn for my next [knitting]{.highlight3} project. Or playing countless rounds of [Doppelkopf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelkopf) with friends.
