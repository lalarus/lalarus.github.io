[Welcome to my little corner üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ]{.text-large} 

This is the very first website I'm coding for myself. And it's really been an adventure so far! However, maybe you know the struggle: if it's suddenly something for (or even worse, *about*) yourself, it will be taking you forever. That's why this space is still looking a bit blank, so bear with me!

Meanwhile:
[Learn more about me](about/index.qmd) or have a dip into [my portfolio](portfolio/index.qmd).<br>
More into a long-read? Then have a look at [my blog](blog/index.qmd).

:::{.g-col-12 .g-col-sm-6 .emphasize-box .card .card-body}
##### Ever-growing wishlist for the website:
- acessibility: fig-alt text on all images
- images: keeping size small, default ratio 5:3
- have a nice own logo
- creating a TLDR component of its own instead of tweaking Quarto's callout buttons
