[Welcome to my little corner üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ]{.text-large} 

This is the very first website I'm coding for myself. And maybe you know the struggle: as soon as it's something for you ‚Äì or even worse, *about* you ‚Äì it suddenly takes you forever. That's why this space is still looking a bit blank, so bear with me!

Meanwhile:
[Learn more about me](about/index.qmd) or have a dip into [my portfolio](portfolio/index.qmd).<br>
More into a long-read? Then have a look at [my blog](blog/index.qmd). <br><br><br>

##### Ever-growing website wishlist:
- Accessibility
  - Add fig-alt text on all images
  - Add breadcrumbs
  - Run accessibility check on the whole website
- Have a nice own logo
- Create a TLDR component of its own instead of tweaking Quarto's callout buttons
- Add semantic/structured data markup ([schema.org](https://www.schema.org/))
- Dark mode
- Portfolio
  - Finish 'Designing to support user agency'
  - Expand on 'Green Kolding'
  - Add TLDR for 'Coding my own website'
  - Filtering by tags: Add a list of categories (that allows user to remove filtering after they clicked on a tag)
- Blog
  - Write 'Every design is political'
