# Hallo!

[Welcome to my little corner üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ]{.text-large} 

This is the very first website I'm coding for myself. And maybe you know the struggle: when it's suddenly something for/about yourself, it's taking you forever. That's why this space is still looking a bit blank, so bear with me!

Meanwhile:
[Learn more about me &#x2197;](about/index.qmd) or have a dip into [my portfolio &#x2197;](about/portfolio.qmd).<br>
More into a long-read? Then have a look at [my blog &#x2197;](about/blog.qmd).
