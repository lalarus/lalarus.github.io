Feeling the strain in my body during a run.\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of ‚Äúde Finibus Bonorum et Malorum‚Äù (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, ‚ÄúLorem ipsum dolor sit amet..‚Äù, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from ‚Äúde Finibus Bonorum et Malorum‚Äù by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n/// // // // // // //"

I therefore explored how we can design interfaces that give back control (i.e.¬†user agency) toward the people who interact with these interfaces. \n\n\n\nFollowing a design thinking approach, I used desk research, probe studies and affinity mapping to explore how design mechanisms on Instagram support and undermine user control. Through experience prototyping, I then developed alternative design patterns that support sense of agency.\n\n\n\nI identified six design patterns that describe how design mechanisms on Instagram support and undermine user control. I further developed 4 prototypes that redesign Instagram‚Äôs design mechanisms for greater user agency."

Sie ist ein Standvogel (d.¬†h. kein Zugvogel) und verl√§sst die Brutgew√§sser nur, wenn sie zufrieren.\nDie Wasseramsel ist mit 13 Unterarten von Westeuropa und Nordwestafrika ostw√§rts bis in die Region um den Baikalsee und in die Hochlagen Westchinas verbreitet.\nNach starken Einbu√üen in der zweiten H√§lfte des 20. Jh. haben sich die Best√§nde der meisten Unterarten weitgehend erholt. Die Art gilt nach Einsch√§tzung der IUCN als nicht gef√§hrdet (Least Concern).\nDie Wasseramsel ist seit 1963 der Nationalvogel Norwegens.[1]"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Every design carries ethical responsibility. It was a lecture on ¬ªValue-based Design¬´ during my time at SDU that sparked my passion for ethics and responsibility in design.\nThough he rejects what he calls ‚Äúna√Øve technological determinism,‚Äù Winner argues that ‚Äúcertain technologies in themselves have political properties.‚Äù He indicates two ways in which this occurs:\n‚Äúthe invention, design, or arrangement of a specific technical device or system becomes a way of settling an issue in the affairs of a particular community‚Äù or ‚Äúinherently political technologies‚Äù which ‚Äúappear to require or to be strongly compatible with particular kinds of political relationships.‚Äù Technical Arrangements and Social Order The most commonly cited example from Winner‚Äôs essay is the height of the bridges over park ways on Long Island. Robert Moses build them according to specifications that would discourage the presence of buses. ‚ÄúOne consequence was to limit access of racial minorities and low-income groups to Jones Beach, Moses‚Äô widely acclaimed public park. Moses made doubly sure of this result by vetoing a proposed extension of the Long Island Roach to Jones Beach. This is a demonstration of technological design that enforced a particular political agenda. Lessig cites this as a case of architecture being used as a modality of constraint on behavior.\nWinner provides other examples of consciously political design: I mean, it‚Äôs pretty cool that content can go in the margin, right??  It could even be a picture:  The book page reads verdere expedities which is Dutch for ‚Äúfurther expeditions‚Äù\n‚ÄúBaron Haussmann‚Äôs broad Parisian thoroughfares, engineered at Louis Napoleon‚Äôs direction to prevent any recurrence of street fighting of the kind that took place during the revolution of 1848,‚Äù ‚Äúconcrete buildings and huge plazas constructed on university campuses in the United States during the late 1960s and early 1970 to defuse student demonstrations,‚Äù Cyrus McCormick‚Äôs introduction of pneumatic molding machines into his Chicago reaper manufacturing plant in the 1880s, in order to ‚Äúweed out‚Äù the skilled workers who had organized a local union. Winner points out, however, that ‚Äúto recognize the political dimensions in the shapes of technology does not require that we look for conscious conspiracies or malicious intentions.‚Äù There are other interesting cases in which ‚Äúthe technological deck has been stacked in advance in favor of certain social interests,‚Äù even though this stacking may not have been a conscious choice on anyone‚Äôs part:\nFailure to accommodate for individuals with disabilities has arisen ‚Äúmore from long-standing neglect than from anyone‚Äôs active intention.‚Äù Many recent federal regulations have been written to address this neglect. The introduction of mechanical tomato harvesters inspires the breading of new varieties of tomatoes, which are able to better handle the machinery‚Äôs rough motion. The combination of new equipment and new tomato breeds has had a dramatic effect on farm communities, which have been displaced by large agri-businesses. Inherently Political Technologies Many technologies, Winner argues, are inherently political, since their very creation and operation requires specific social arrangements:\nPlato‚Äôs Republic emphasized that ‚Äúno reasonable person believes that ships can be run democratically,‚Äù since their operation requires the coordination of so many individual workers. Large ships require social hierarchies that one-person canoes do not. Friedrich Engels pointed out that complex technical systems, such as large production factories, can serve as a means to reinforce centralized control. As the systems get more complex, ‚Äúcentral control by knowledgeable people acting at the top of a rigid social hierarchy would seem increasingly prudent.‚Äù Winner also quotes Jerry Mander, who explains that ‚Äúif you accept nuclear power plants, you also accept a techno-scientific industrial-military elite. Without these people in charge, you could not have nuclear power.‚Äù Conversely, environmental activist have often lauded the democratizing qualities of solar energy, which tends to work against the concentration of power in the hands of large institutions. ‚ÄúTaking the most obvious example, the atom bomb is an inherently political artifact. As long as it exists at all, its lethal properties demand that it be controlled by a centralized, rigidly hierarchical, chain of command closed to all influences that might make its workings unpredictable.‚Äù This is a ‚Äúmatter of practical necessity independent of any larger political system in which the bomb is embedded.‚Äù Implications: Winner‚Äôs arguments can be important to both creators and consumers of new technology. Winner points out that the political nature of certain technologies have been used by both ends of the political spectrum. And designers of roads have purposely specified the height of bridges to keep populations of lower socio-economic status out of certain areas.\nWhen considering technological change, Winner identifies two broad types of choices:\n‚Äúyes or no‚Äù on whether to adopt a new technology and ‚Äúspecial features in the design or arrangement of a technical system‚Äù for which the answer to the first choice was ‚Äúyes.‚Äù The most important thing to recognize about these choices is that they often go far being pragmatic concerns about what tool would be best or most cost-effective for a given job. Many amount to the selection of ‚Äúforms of life,‚Äù since they embody certain possibilities more than others. The ‚Äúgreatest latitude of choice exists the very first time a particular instrument, system, or technique is introduced,‚Äù so ‚Äúthe same careful attention that one would give to the rules, roles, and relationships of politics must also be given‚Äù to such technological choices. In contemporary society, such decisions are often not recognized as such. The advancement of certain ends has become so ingrained in our thinking that we fail to recognize reasons other than those of practical necessity toward those ends. ‚ÄúIn many instances, to say that some technologies are inherently political is to say that certain widely accepted reasons of practical necessity‚Äîespecially the need to maintain crucial technological systems as smoothly working entities‚Äîhave tended to eclipse other sorts of moral and political reasoning.‚Äù\nFor many areas of ICT implementation, we are still fortunate to be at an early enough stage that such a latitude of choice is available to us. ICTs that are introduced into an environment can embody specific social arrangements and continuously reinforce those arrangements through the possibilities (what are often called ‚Äúaffordances‚Äù) for action that they imply.\nConsidering such consequences is essential, in order to introduce technologies in ways that will advance, rather than hinder, the social values that the Kellogg Foundation espouses. It is important not to simply accept the incentive to join the forces of technological ‚Äúprogress‚Äù at face value. ‚ÄúIn our times people are often willing to make drastic changes in the why they live to accommodate technological innovation while at the same time resisting similar kinds of changes justified on political grounds. If for no other reason than that, it is important for us to achieve a clearer view of these matters than has been our habit so far.‚Äù"

    "text": "In the constant competition of vying for humans‚Äô attention, online platforms and digital technolo- gies commonly design their interfaces in a way that undermines user‚Äôs self-control. This loss of agency that users experience over their technol- ogy use comes with detrimental effects on their well-being. Short-term effects include feelings of frustration and guilt, and procrastination. They often translate to more long-term decreases in cognitive well-being such as behavioral addiction and reduced life satisfaction. This paper therefore explores and rede- signs design mechanisms on Instagram for a greater sense of user agency. Following a design thinking approach, I use desk research, probe studies and affinity mapping to understand how we can design interfaces that give back control toward the people who interact with these inter- faces. My probe study results identify six design patterns that describe how design mechanisms on Instagram support and undermine user con- trol. They confirm prior work that has explored sense of agency in the design for digital well-be- ing. As the most notable result, existing design mechanisms on Instagram made my participants feel low in control in four ways: by imposing unwanted information, by showing highly per- sonalized content, by creating fear of missing out, and by determining the ease of an interaction."

It could even be a picture:  The book page reads verdere expedities which is Dutch for ‚Äúfurther expeditions‚Äù\n‚ÄúBaron Haussmann‚Äôs broad Parisian thoroughfares, engineered at Louis Napoleon‚Äôs direction to prevent any recurrence of street fighting of the kind that took place during the revolution of 1848,‚Äù ‚Äúconcrete buildings and huge plazas constructed on university campuses in the United States during the late 1960s and early 1970 to defuse student demonstrations,‚Äù Cyrus McCormick‚Äôs introduction of pneumatic molding machines into his Chicago reaper manufacturing plant in the 1880s, in order to ‚Äúweed out‚Äù the skilled workers who had organized a local union. Winner points out, however, that ‚Äúto recognize the political dimensions in the shapes of technology does not require that we look for conscious conspiracies or malicious intentions.‚Äù There are other interesting cases in which ‚Äúthe technological deck has been stacked in advance in favor of certain social interests,‚Äù even though this stacking may not have been a conscious choice on anyone‚Äôs part:\nFailure to accommodate for individuals with disabilities has arisen ‚Äúmore from long-standing neglect than from anyone‚Äôs active intention.‚Äù Many recent federal regulations have been written to address this neglect. The introduction of mechanical tomato harvesters inspires the breading of new varieties of tomatoes, which are able to better handle the machinery‚Äôs rough motion. The combination of new equipment and new tomato breeds has had a dramatic effect on farm communities, which have been displaced by large agri-businesses. Inherently Political Technologies Many technologies, Winner argues, are inherently political, since their very creation and operation requires specific social arrangements:\nPlato‚Äôs Republic emphasized that ‚Äúno reasonable person believes that ships can be run democratically,‚Äù since their operation requires the coordination of so many individual workers. Large ships require social hierarchies that one-person canoes do not. Friedrich Engels pointed out that complex technical systems, such as large production factories, can serve as a means to reinforce centralized control. As the systems get more complex, ‚Äúcentral control by knowledgeable people acting at the top of a rigid social hierarchy would seem increasingly prudent.‚Äù Winner also quotes Jerry Mander, who explains that ‚Äúif you accept nuclear power plants, you also accept a techno-scientific industrial-military elite. Without these people in charge, you could not have nuclear power.‚Äù Conversely, environmental activist have often lauded the democratizing qualities of solar energy, which tends to work against the concentration of power in the hands of large institutions. ‚ÄúTaking the most obvious example, the atom bomb is an inherently political artifact. As long as it exists at all, its lethal properties demand that it be controlled by a centralized, rigidly hierarchical, chain of command closed to all influences that might make its workings unpredictable.‚Äù This is a ‚Äúmatter of practical necessity independent of any larger political system in which the bomb is embedded.‚Äù Implications: Winner‚Äôs arguments can be important to both creators and consumers of new technology. Winner points out that the political nature of certain technologies have been used by both ends of the political spectrum. And designers of roads have purposely specified the height of bridges to keep populations of lower socio-economic status out of certain areas.\nWhen considering technological change, Winner identifies two broad types of choices:\n‚Äúyes or no‚Äù on whether to adopt a new technology and ‚Äúspecial features in the design or arrangement of a technical system‚Äù for which the answer to the first choice was ‚Äúyes.‚Äù The most important thing to recognize about these choices is that they often go far being pragmatic concerns about what tool would be best or most cost-effective for a given job. Many amount to the selection of ‚Äúforms of life,‚Äù since they embody certain possibilities more than others. The ‚Äúgreatest latitude of choice exists the very first time a particular instrument, system, or technique is introduced,‚Äù so ‚Äúthe same careful attention that one would give to the rules, roles, and relationships of politics must also be given‚Äù to such technological choices. In contemporary society, such decisions are often not recognized as such. The advancement of certain ends has become so ingrained in our thinking that we fail to recognize reasons other than those of practical necessity toward those ends. ‚ÄúIn many instances, to say that some technologies are inherently political is to say that certain widely accepted reasons of practical necessity‚Äîespecially the need to maintain crucial technological systems as smoothly working entities‚Äîhave tended to eclipse other sorts of moral and political reasoning.‚Äù\nFor many areas of ICT implementation, we are still fortunate to be at an early enough stage that such a latitude of choice is available to us. ICTs that are introduced into an environment can embody specific social arrangements and continuously reinforce those arrangements through the possibilities (what are often called ‚Äúaffordances‚Äù) for action that they imply.\nConsidering such consequences is essential, in order to introduce technologies in ways that will advance, rather than hinder, the social values that the Kellogg Foundation espouses. It is important not to simply accept the incentive to join the forces of technological ‚Äúprogress‚Äù at face value. ‚ÄúIn our times people are often willing to make drastic changes in the why they live to accommodate technological innovation while at the same time resisting similar kinds of changes justified on political grounds. If for no other reason than that, it is important for us to achieve a clearer view of these matters than has been our habit so far.‚Äù"

    "text": "Relevance: Capturing attention at all costs\nInformation technology is tightly woven through our contemporary lives, offering broad access to communication, knowledge, and entertainment. However, this wealth of information has made attention a scarce and therefore precious resource. This has resulted in a competition in which a very small number of exeptionally powerful organizations are continuously vying for people‚Äôs attention. Their technologies and products present ubiquitous temptations that frequently clash with other important activities in our lives. \n\n\nMoreover, information and communication technologies (ICT) are designed in a way that makes them exceptionally hard to resist: While people‚Äôs failure rate is 31% for smoking and 28% for drinking alcohol, they fail to resist media use 78% of the time (see figure). This is because design mechanisms such as push notifications and autoplay create task interruptions and task-irrelevant thoughts that put an additional strain on the self-control capacity of media users.  This loss of agency that users experience over their technology use comes with detrimental effects on their well-being. Short-term effects such as feelings of fruststration and guilt often translate to more long-term decreases in cognitive well-being, including behavioral addiction and reduced life satisfaction. I therefore asked:\n\nHow can we design interfaces that give back control (i.e., user agency) toward the people who interact with these interfaces?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Æ§ Media use shows the highest self-control failure rate of all 14 types of temptations. 1"

The results revealed distinct design features across Instagram‚Äôs design mechanisms that made participants feel less or more in control. I further identified 4 higher-level design patterns that describe how these design mechanisms undermine user sense of agency (see figure, visualized by four spherical shapes). These results informed my second research question:\n\nRQII: What are alternative design mechanisms in the Instagram mobile app that might support sense of agency?\n\nAnalogue to the second Diamond of the design thinking process, the second part of my research process was concerned with finding solutions through ideating. For this, I developed four How might we (HMW) questions. Each question was based on one of the four design patterns for low agency. After generating a wide range of ideas, I chose to continue with one idea for each design challenge which resulted in a total of four experience prototypes. For potential inquries in the future (see figure, visualized by using lower contrast) I propose user testings to test whether the developed experience prototypes successfully support user sense of agency.\n\n\n\n‚Æ§ Research study design"

    "text": "Discover: From desk research to intervention\nI began my project with desk research, exploring the following three research areas: dark patterns of interaction design, philosophy of technology and previous work on sense of agency for well-being. The results contributed an essential component of groundwork to my research as well as informed the further course of my research process. For example, there is a need for research to identify and examine design patterns that manipulate users into spending time and attention in an app against their best interests (so-called attention capture dark patterns). 2\nI then designed and conducted my own intervention: a probe study with a total of 12 participants. My aim was to collect user experiences and form an empathic understanding of how existing design mechanisms in the Instagram mobile app influence user sense of agency. Each probe kit included 2 assignments and 2 corresponding diaries (see figure). The first assignment asked participants to name and explain things that made them feel least in control (LC) of how they spend their time on Instagram. Thereafter, the second assignment asked them to name and explain things that made them feel most in control (MC).\n\n\n\n‚Æ§ A snapshot of the creation process of a diary (top-left), the cover of a final diary (top-right), and the first double page of a low control diary (bottom)\n\n\nBesides the diary, each participant received a number of other materials (see figure).

Having started out with many early-attracted members shortly before the Covid-19 pandemic, the organization struggles to attract any participants at all ever since they started meeting again. Another problem is the member‚Äôs uncertainty about what Green Kolding stands for.\n\n\n\nI conceptualized and conducted a co-design workshop with members and non-members to explore and define Green Kolding‚Äôs identity. We then interviewed the two heads of the organization. Analyzing the data with empathy mapping allowed us to identify the need for a website which communicates Green Kolding‚Äôs identity and attracts new members. We developed a website prototype and conducted user experience tests with the target group.\n\n\n\nThe workshop outcomes were limited to impulses for Green Kolding‚Äôs identity as participants who did not know Green Kolding prior to the workshop were numerically overrepresented and therfore overshadowed the opinions and perceptions of active members. Our interviews, on the other hand, revealed a deeper understanding of the organization‚Äôs self-perception and needs. Testing our website prototype revealed that the organization‚Äôs identity remains vague and discourages potential members from joining."

Dort ern√§hrt sich die Art vornehmlich von Wasserinsekten, die sie vor allem tauchend erbeutet.\nDie Art erbaut umfangreiche Kugelnester in Halbh√∂hlen oder nat√ºrlichen H√∂hlen entlang ihrer Nahrungsgew√§sser, in Uferverbauungen sowie unter Br√ºcken und anderen flussbegleitenden Bauwerken. Sie ist ein Standvogel (d.¬†h. kein Zugvogel) und verl√§sst die Brutgew√§sser nur, wenn sie zufrieren.\nDie Wasseramsel ist mit 13 Unterarten von Westeuropa und Nordwestafrika ostw√§rts bis in die Region um den Baikalsee und in die Hochlagen Westchinas verbreitet.\nNach starken Einbu√üen in der zweiten H√§lfte des 20. Jh. haben sich die Best√§nde der meisten Unterarten weitgehend erholt.
